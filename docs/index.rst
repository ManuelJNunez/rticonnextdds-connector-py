Getting Started
===============

RTI® Connext® DDS is a connectivity software framework for integrating data
sources of all types. At its core is the world's leading ultra-high performance,
distributed networking databus.

*RTI Connector* provides a simplified API for the rapid development of
applications that publish and subscribe to the *RTI Connext DDS databus*.

In *RTI Connector*, you define your types, QoS profiles and DDS Entities in XML.
Then you load the configuration using a Connector object (:ref:`Using a Connector`),
which allows you to write to and read from DDS *Topics* (:ref:`Writing Data (Output)`,
:ref:`Reading Data (Input)`).

This documentation assumes you're familiar with *DDS*. For an overview,
see `An Introduction to DDS <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_GettingStarted/index.htm#GettingStarted/An_Introduction_to_.htm#dds_2424438477_346722%3FTocPath%3D3.%2520A%25C2%25A0Quick%2520Overview%7C3.3%2520An%2520Introduction%2520to%2520DDS%7C_____0>`__
in the *RTI Connext DDS Core Libraries Getting Started Guide*. More documentation
is available in the `RTI Community Portal <https://community.rti.com/documentation>`__

This is the documentation of the *Python* binding. For other supported languages,
see the `rticonnextdds-connector <https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector>`__ repository.
